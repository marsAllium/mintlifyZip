title: "Stablecoins"
---

Our `crosschain.stablecoin` schemas allow users to investigate onchain stablecoin activity across multiple blockchains.

The stablecoin vertical supports currencies aside from usd (e.g. cny, jpy, try, eur, cad, etc.)

## Stablecoins List

The stablecoin list includes a list of curated stablecoins with various denominations. This list is used to identify the list of stablecoins to be included in the `crosschain.stablecoin.transfers` table.

**Unique Key**: `chain`, `address`

| Column Name | Description                                                                                                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| currency    | The ISO currency code (e.g. usd, eur, jpy, xau (gold)) of the stablecoin, in lower case.                        |
| base\_asset | The underlying stablecoin for stablecoins that are issued by third parties, such as bridges, or defi-protocols. |
| address     | The contract address of the stablecoin. The contract address for a stablecoin is unique on the blockchain.      |
| symbol      | Symbol of the token, in lower case by default.                                                                  |
| name        | Name of the token.                                                                                              |
| decimals    | Decimals of the token, used for normalization. This field is optional and may be null.                          |
| chain       | Blockchain of the where the stablecoin is based, in lower case.                                                 |
| is\_bridge  | When TRUE, this means that the stablecoin is bridged.                                                           |

Stablecoin Base Assets

Stablecoins can be broadly classified into their underlying **peg mechanism.**

They can be fiat-backed, commodity-backed, algorithmic, crypto-backed (DAI), or a hybrid of many.

For **fiat-backed stablecoins**, there is often a regulated entity involved in the issuance and management of the stablecoin ensuring its stability and value. These entity-issued stablecoins are said to be "native".

Using USDC as an example, there are multiple variants of USDC:

* A **native stablecoin** refers to a stablecoin issued directly from a regulated entity such as Circle, which is redeemable for the underlying asset (be it US Dollars, Euros, etc). Circle maintains a list of their native stablecoins [here](https://www.circle.com/en/multi-chain-usdc).

* A **bridged stablecoin** refers to a stablecoin that is issued by a third-party application (e.g. Wormhole, Axelar, etc.) issued by locking a native stablecoin in a smart contract on one blockchain to mint a bridged stablecoin on another blockchain.

* A **defi variant stablecoin** refers to a stablecoin issued by a decentralized application (e.g. Compound, Aave, etc.) and is backed by the underlying collateral assets in the protocol. One example is Aave interest-bearing USDC [(aUSDC)](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbcca60bb61934080951369a648fb03df4f96263c).

The `base_asset` field in the stablecoin list aims to capture the underlying stablecoin of a token. For example, Axelar USDC, Aave USDC, and Bridged USDC.e on Avalanche will all be labelled as `usdc` its `base_asset`.

## Stablecoin Transfers

The stablecoin transfers table contains all on-chain transfers of stablecoins found in the stablecoin list. This table allows users to aggregate stablecoin activity across multiple chains while also fetching granular transfer details.

## Stablecoin Metrics

The `crosschain.metrics.stablecoin_volume` table aggregates stablecoin activity from `crosschain.stablecoin.transfers` by day, chain and token address.

It includes adjusted activity metrics using the following methodologies:

* **Single Direction Max Transfer -** only the largest stablecoin amount transferred within a single transaction is counted

* **Single Direction Net Transfer -** the largest net stablecoin amount transferred per token, to a single address, for each transaction, is counted

* **Entity Adjusted, Single Direction Max Transfer -** in addition, to applying the Single Direction Max Transfer logic, this methodology also uses labels & heuristics to remove bot related activity (e.g. if an address does more than 1,000 transactions and \$10m in transfer volume in a rolling 30-day window), or intra-exchange volume (i.e. when transfers are made between two CEX/DEX addresses)

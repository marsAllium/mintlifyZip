## Caveat on Time Columns

For most cases, you should use the *nearest\_date* column. Here is why:

The data returned from DefiLlama has daily timestamps with time 00:00:00, except for the latest record which corresponds to the latest data available in DefiLlama. For example, if we scrape the data corresponding to the protocol at 4 Mar 03:00, we may get records with the timestamps:

* 1 Mar 00:00

* 2 Mar 00:00

* 3 Mar 00:00

* 3 Mar 23:00 (assuming data in DefiLlama corresponding to this protocol has freshness of 4 hours) The timestamps above are stored in the `actual_timestamp` column.

The deprecated `date` column truncates the times from the timestamp column above. In this case, it will store dates 1 Mar, 2 Mar, 3 Mar, and another 3 Mar. This is likely undesirable for you.

The `nearest_date` column instead rounds the time to the nearest date. In this case, it will store dates 1 Mar, 2 Mar, 3 Mar, and 4 Mar, ensuring that each date contains a data even when we fetch a slightly late data.

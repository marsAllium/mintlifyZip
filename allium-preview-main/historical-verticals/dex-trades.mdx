title: "DEX Trades"
---

The`crosschain.dex.trades` table aggregates DEX trades indexed by Allium across multiple blockchains (EVM and non-EVM) into a single table.

The `crosschain.dex.trades_evm` table aggregates DEX trades on EVM-compatible blockchain. This model includes EVM-specific fee details (e.g. priority fees) that are not found on non-EVM chains.

### Blockchain Coverage

OverviewEVM CoverageSolana Coverage

This table currently **does not contain aggregator swaps** to avoid double-counting volume.

The dex trades table only contains swap events/instructions from DEXs with liquidity pools/vaults.

For example, suppose a DEX swap was executed by an aggregator (e.g. Openocean or 0x) and routed to liquidity pools on Uniswap and Balancer, **o**nly the volume on Uniswap and Balancer is included `dex.trades.`

Coverage of DEX Protocols Across various EVM Blockchains. Note that for a single protocol (e.g. uniswap\_v2) there can be multiple dex projects (e.g. uniswap, sushiswap).

**Other EVM-Compatible Chains**

Tron's TVM (Tron Virtual Machine) is EVM-compatible, but there are specific differences, particularly in its network fee structure. Unlike the EVM, TVM uses energy instead of gas, with TRX as the ecosystem gas token. This is why we don't consider it completely EVM-compatible. Additionally, addresses are in Base58.

### Sample Query

DEX VolumeDEX Transaction Fees

Query DEX Volume and Users Across Blockchains indexed by Allium in the last 90 days.

Copy

```
select
    date(block_timestamp) as date,
    chain,
    sum(usd_amount) as usd_volume,
    count(distinct transaction_from_address) as traders
from crosschain.dex.trades
where block_timestamp >= current_timestamp - interval '90 days'
group by all
```

ℹ️ This is only applicable for EVM DEXs in the `crosschain.dex.trades_evm` model.

Dividing the transaction fees by swap count is required as fees are computed at the transaction level and there are dex trades within a same transaction with multiple hops.

Copy

```
select
    date(block_timestamp) as date,
    chain,
    count(distinct transaction_from_address) as distinct_users,  -- Number of unique users
    avg(usd_amount) as avg_usd_volume,  -- Average swap volume in USD
    sum(usd_amount) as total_usd_volume,  -- Total trade volume in USD by chain
    sum(transaction_fees_usd / swap_count) as total_fees_usd  -- Total fees USD 
from crosschain.dex.trades_evm
where block_timestamp > current_timestamp - interval '6 months'
group by all
order by 1 desc
```

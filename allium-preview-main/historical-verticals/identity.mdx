title: "Identity"
---

The identity schema is nested under the `common` database.

The identity tables contain wallet labels and names which can be used to enhance the depth of your analysis.
<Info>
Wallet addresses from some blockchains are **case-sensitive**. That is, you should not lowercase the wallet addresses when doing joins / analysis.

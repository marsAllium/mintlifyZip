title: "Chain Metrics"
---

Our Chain Metrics feature offers a powerful advantage: pre-computed blockchain metrics that save you valuable time and resources.

**How It Works:**

We regularly process vast amounts of blockchain data, computing essential metrics like daily active addresses, transaction volumes, and gas usage.

These metrics are stored in easily accessible tables, allowing you to retrieve them with a single line of query.

**Use Cases:**

* Generate time-series data for visualizations without the need to write custom code.

* Effortlessly compare metrics across different periods and blockchains.

* Easily integrate blockchain metrics into your applications or dashboards.

## Tables

There are two ways to query for chain metrics:

1. using `crosschain.metrics.overview`, which makes it easy to compare metrics across chains *(if included)*

2. using `<chain>.metrics.overview`, which makes it easy to view relevant metrics for your desired chain

| `crosschain.metrics.overview` | Daily metrics, grouped by chain, covering onchain activity such as transactions, users, fees, tokens transfers, DEXes, NFTs, stablecoins and more. Metrics are not available for all chains. The column values will be `null` if not available for the given chain. | * arbitrum

| `<chain>.metrics.overview`    | Daily metrics for a single chain. Only includes metrics that are available.                                                                                                                                                                                         | - All chains above                                                                                                         |

### Sample Queries

**1)** Get historical metrics for all available chains

Copy

```
select * from crosschain.metrics.overview order by activity_date desc
```

**2)** Get metrics from the last 90 days for Ethereum

Copy

```
select
    *
from crosschain.metrics.overview
where 1=1
    and chain = 'ethereum'
    and activity_date >= current_date - interval '90 days'
order by activity_date desc
```

**3)** Get total transaction fees / chain revenue for Base

Copy

```
select
    activity_date,
    transaction_fees, -- in native token, i.e. ETH
    transaction_fees_usd -- in USD
from base.metrics.overview
```

## Notes

* **Fee Metrics**

  * average transfer fee metrics are based on simple transaction types with single, direct transfers between two wallet addresses, e.g.

    * for EVM chains, native token transfers where the input is `0x` and ERCX token transfers where the transfer functions are called directly by the transacting user

    * for Solana, we exclude transfers initiated via program and instead limit to transactions with only 1 transfer initiated by the address sending the token (i.e. `signer = from_address`)

  * `average_transaction_fees` and `average_transaction_fees_usd` exclude system transactions or other 0 fee transactions, as they would skew metrics downwards

* **Token Transfer Metrics**

  * `user_initiated` metrics exclude transactions initiated by contracts

  * For EVM, `native_token_transfer_count` accounts for all native token transfers including gas/fee payments, but `native_token_value_transfer_count` excludes those, limiting it to transfers between EOAs/contracts. Similarly, on Solana, `native_token_value_transfer_count` excludes SOL transfers for [rent](https://solana.com/docs/core/rent) which is needed for the creation or closure of token accounts

  * currently, there are only volume metrics for `usd` stablecoins, as we don't currently have prices/exchange rate conversions for non-USD currencies

* **Solana Nuances**

  * The [SPL token standard](https://spl.solana.com/token) can be flexibly used for both fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). We identify NFTs by their `mint` address.

* **Other**

  * `USD` metrics (e.g. `erc20_transfer_volume_usd` , `dex_volume_usd` , `nft_volume_usd`) are subject to changes as our token/DEX/NFT coverage & price data become more complete or are updated

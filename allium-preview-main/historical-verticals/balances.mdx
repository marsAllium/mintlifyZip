title: "Balances"
description: "Fetch block-level changes in the balances of assets across wallets."
---

The `crosschain.assets.fungible_balances_evm` model offers a historical record of fungible asset balances, including native gas tokens and ERC-20 compatible tokens.

Each entry in the model corresponds to a specific event/transaction that causes a balance change in a particular asset at the block level.

This means **a new data entry is only created when a transaction alters an asset's balance at the block level.**

* For example, if a wallet receives 1 ETH in 2015 and experiences no further changes until yesterday, the model will have two entries: one for the initial receipt in 2015 and another for the recent change

## Blockchain Coverage

EVM-compatible blockchains supported:

* ethereum, avalanche, arbitrum, base, bsc (Binance Smart Chain), polygon, optimism.

## Sample Query
<Accordion title="Generate Daily Balances from block-level balances data">
\[1] Replace the `wallet` CTE with the desired list of wallet addresses (comma-separated) or the table of wallet addresses

\[2] Replace the 'day' argument in `date_trunc` function to adjust the granularity of the balance output (day, week, month, year).

```sql

    wallets as (
        select distinct value::varchar as wallet_address

            t1.address,

            lag(t2.balance) ignore nulls over (partition by t1.chain, t1.address, t1.token_address order by t1.date) as balance
        from date_address_token_cte t1
        left join balances t2 on t1.date = t2.date and t1.chain = t2.chain and t1.address = t2.address and t1.token_address = t2.token_address
        where 1 = 1
    )
    
select
    f.chain,
    f.date,
    f.address,
    f.token_address,
    f.token_name,
    f.token_symbol,
    f.raw_balance,
    f.balance,
    hourly.price as usd_exchange_rate,
    coalesce(hourly.price * f.balance, hourly.price * f.raw_balance / pow(10, hourly.decimals), f.usd_balance) as usd_balance
from final f
left join common.prices.hourly on f.date = hourly.timestamp and f.chain = hourly.chain and f.token_address = hourly.address
where f.raw_balance > 0
order by 1 desc
```

**Note**: the final output will contain all tokens held by the wallet, including undesirable spam tokens.

One approach to counter this would be to filter the output of the query with the desired tokens or balances above a certain USD value.

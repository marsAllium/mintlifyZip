title: "DEX Token Prices Hourly"

### DEX Token Prices

The`dex_token_prices_hourly` contains hourly price data of tokens derived from swaps performed on decentralized exchanges.

### Chains Supported

* arbitrum, avalanche, base, blast, bsc, celo, ethereum, optimism, polygon, solana, worldchain, zksync, zora

### Methodology

To ensure accuracy in our token price calculations, we only include swaps with a value exceeding 1 USD. We employ a volume-weighted approach to determine token prices.

For a given token, the total USD swap volume (encompassing both sold and bought volumes) is divided by the total volume of the token swapped in DEX trades.

For example. if Token A has a swap volume of 200,000 USD and the total volume of Token A swapped is 18,000 units within a given hour, the price is calculated as follows:

Here, the calculated price is 11.111 USD, with a USD trading volume of 200,000.

### Limitations

Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) derived token prices face several key limitations in price reliability.

Low liquidity for certain tokens can lead to significant price volatility and slippage during trades. Market manipulation through practices like wash trading and arbitrage can artificially influence token prices, resulting in misleading data.

To address these concerns, our DEX token prices table incorporates trade count and volume metrics, enabling users to filter out potentially unreliable price information.

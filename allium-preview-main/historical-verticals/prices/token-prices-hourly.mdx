## Hourly Token Prices

`common.prices.hourly` provides hourly price data by token address across various Blockchains combined with token prices computed from DEX trades.

We preferentially select non-DEX data. That is, if for the same hour, there is a same chain + address that has DEX token prices and externally ingested prices, we will select the externally ingested price.

This table is unique by timestamp (hour), chain and address.

### Sample Query

Using `common.prices.hourly` to investigate the USD volume of Flash loans performed on Balancer in the last 7 days

Copy

```
select
    date(block_timestamp) as date,
    params['token']::varchar as token,
    hourly.symbol as token_symbol,
    sum(params ['amount'] / pow(10, hourly.decimals) * hourly.price) as usd_volume
from
    ethereum.decoded.logs
    left join common.prices.hourly on date_trunc('hour', block_timestamp) = hourly.timestamp
    and hourly.address = token
    and chain = 'ethereum'
where logs.block_timestamp >= current_timestamp - interval '7 days'
    and logs.address = '0xba12222222228d8ba445958a75a0704d566bf2c8'
    and logs.topic0 = '0x0d7d75e01ab95780d3cd1c8ec0dd6c2ce19e3a20427eec8bf53283b6fb8e95f0'
group by all 
```

The `crosschain.bridges.transfers` aggregates transaction-level bridge transfers across multiple blockchains indexed by Allium.

We are actively improving bridge protocol & blockchain coverage and data completeness for the bridges vertical.

### Blockchain Coverage

The `crosschain.bridges.transfers` includes bridge transfers indexed from the following blockchains.

| Blockchains                                                                                     | Total Blockchains Supported |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| arbitrum, avalanche, base, blast, bsc, ethereum, fantom, linea, mode, optimism, polygon, scroll | 12                          |

### Source and Destination Blockchain Coverage

A bridge event connects a source blockchain (origin of the asset) to a destination blockchain (target for the bridged asset).

**The total number of source and destination blockchains covered can be greater than the number of blockchains covered.**

An example would be indexing the canonical bridge event of L2 Worldchain will allow us to cover bridge events between Ethereum\<>Worldchain without indexing Worldchain events.

| Distinct Source Blockchains | Distinct Destination Blockchains |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 61                          | 139                              |

### Bridge Types

We broadly classify bridges into the following types:

* **Applications bridges:** bridges that have their underlying liquidity/mechanism to transfer assets across to typically more than one blockchain.

* **Canonical bridges** are bridges from Ethereum to a Rollup and serve as the "official" bridge for the roll-up/blockchain and service 1 destination blockchain.

  * For Canonical Bridges protocols, OP (Optimism Stack) bridges and Arbitrum Bridges will include blockchains under the same ecosystem:

    * **Optimism Stack Bridges**: includes Optimism, Base, Worldchain, Mode, Mint, Redstone, RSS3, Mantle, Manta, Blast, Fraxtal, Zora bridge and more

    * **Arbitrum Orbit Bridges**: Arbitrum, Arbitrum Nova, Alienx

### **Protocol Coverage**

The bridge transfer schema supports both protocols across canonical and application bridge types.

| Bridge Type | Direction            | Protocols                                                                                                   | Count |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| application | outbound only        | circle\_cctp, hop, across, synapse, celer, axelar, zkbridge, stargate, symbiosis, debridge, ybridge, eywa   | 11    |
| canonical   | inbound and outbound | op, arbitrum, polygon, polygon\_zkevm, near, sui, zk\_shared\_bridge, zksync, immutable\_x, starknet, ronin | 11    |

### Directional Coverage

Bridge transfer events include both inbound and outbound transfers. We include inbound and outbound bridge transfers for canonical bridges only.

* **Canonical Bridges on Etheruem Mainnet**

  * **Bridging direction**

    * **Inbound:** bridging from the Ethereum to the destination chain

    * **Outbound**: briding back to Ethereum. E.g. for Base Bridge, this will be from Base -> Ethereum

* **Application and Asset Bridges on EVM-Blockchains (including Ethereum)**

  * **Bridging direction**

    * **Outbound only:** bridging from the source chain (if the transaction originated from Ethereum, this will be the source chain) to the destination

Frequently Asked Questions[](#frequently-asked-questions)

**Q: Why include both inbound and outbound transfers for Canonical bridges and outbound transfers only for Application bridges?**

* This combination of coverage **prevents double-counting bridge volume during simple aggregations**, while including broad coverage of source-destination bridge transfers for canonical bridges from Ethereum to various Layer2s.

**Q: Why do we exclude events from bridge aggregators?**

* We define bridge aggregators as bridges that tap into the underlying mechanism/functionality of other application and canonical bridges.

* Typically, an interaction with such aggregators will result in 2 events, one from the bridge aggregator and another from the underlying bridge. We currently do not include these events in the bridges schema as it would **double count transfer volumes.**

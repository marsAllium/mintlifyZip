## Token Transfers

`crosschain.bridges.wormhole_transfers` provides bridge transfer activity from Wormhole protocol.

The underlying data indexed from Wormhole VAAs and Mayan-emitted messages.

Backfills and verification are still ongoing for the wormhole bridge transfers schema

### Sample Query

Bridges transfer on Wormhole in the last 72 hours

Copy

```
select 
    date_trunc('hour', block_timestamp) as date,
    destination_chain,
    sum(usd_amount) as usd,
    count(1) as c
from crosschain.bridges.wormhole_transfers
where block_timestamp >= current_timestamp - interval '3 days' 
and status in ('completed', 'confirmed')
group by all 
order by 1 desc;
```

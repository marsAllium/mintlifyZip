title: "Generic Decoded Schema Vs Project Specific Decoding"
---

Allium currently supports decoded logs and traces on the schema level.

All decoded event logs and traces for EVM blockchains can be found in the respective `chain.decoded.logs` or `chain.decoded.traces` table.

We currently do not support project-level decoding, that presents 1 event / trace call for each contract and project.

However, all the relevant project-specific contracts can still be found in the decoded vertical tables.

Copy

```
select * from ethereum.decoded.logs
where address = '0xc36442b4a4522e871399cd717abdd847ab11fe88' -- Uniswap V3: Positions NFT
limit 10
```

All events emitted by the contract can be found in one single table

To identify the logs/traces associated with a project of interest, we recommend maintaining a metadata table for your project that filters out for the desired contracts + event/trace calls.

Example:

Copy

```
select * from ethereum.decoded.logs
inner join metadata_table -- Metadata table with the contracts of interest
    on metadata_table.contract_address = logs.address
    and metadata_table.project = 'Uniswap'
    and metadata_table.type = 'logs'
    and metadata_table.event_name = 'DecreaseLiquidity'
```

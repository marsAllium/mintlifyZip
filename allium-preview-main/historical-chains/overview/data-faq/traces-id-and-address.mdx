title: "Traces ID And Address"

## Trace ID

### **Uniqueness Constraint:**

Trace ID is the unique identifier for a trace.

Generated by combining the `trace_type`, `transaction_hash` and `trace_address.`

By default, trace ID should be unique for all traces on a particular blockchain.

### Exceptions:

Exceptions can occur if there are duplicate transactions inherent in the blockchain itself.

The example below shows 3 transactions that share the **same transaction hash.**

As they also share the same trace address and trace type, the traces generated from these 3 transaction will be the same.

In this case, the first 2 transactions will have duplicate trace IDs.

Note that across each EVM there might be slight differences in how these `DUPE` transactions and traces are manifested.

## Trace Address

#### Trace Address field different from the Block explorer

The number of traces Allium has indexed for this transaction is 12, whereas if you count the number of traces that Etherscan has on this [page](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9068357001dc45c59a0c0383860f25fd64daeef205f723c5cbd980f280baca38/advanced#internal), you'll notice that it is 11. Etherscan has chosen to leave out certain types of traces and coupled with how trace addresses are generated, it will result in a different trace address numbering scheme.

In the example above, the trace in the example as indexed by Allium is `{0,0,2,0}` whereas on Etherscan, it's as follows:

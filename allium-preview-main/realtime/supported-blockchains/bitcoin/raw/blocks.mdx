title: "Blocks"
---

Blocks are the building blocks of blockchains. A block contains transactions which will alter the state of the blockchain incrementally. Transaction within a block can only be executed one after the other and utxo movement is sequential based on the order of inputs and outputs within transactions and blocks. Learn more in the official Bitcoin documentation [here](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/block_chain.html).

### Sample Query:

Query to fetch the latest blocks

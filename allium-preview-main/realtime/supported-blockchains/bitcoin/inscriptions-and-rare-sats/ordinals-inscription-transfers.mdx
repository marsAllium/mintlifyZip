title: "Ordinals Inscription Transfers"
---

Ordinals inscription transfers involve moving inscribed satoshis from one Bitcoin wallet to another. Each transfer preserves the inscription's data, maintaining its uniqueness and ownership history on-chain. The process is similar to standard Bitcoin transactions, but with inscribed satoshis acting like digital collectibles. Ownership is updated with each transfer, allowing inscribed satoshis to be traded or collected while remaining part of the Bitcoin blockchain.

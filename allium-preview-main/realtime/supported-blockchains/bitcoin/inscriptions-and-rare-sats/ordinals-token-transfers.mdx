title: "Ordinals Token Transfers"
---

Ordinals token transfers on Bitcoin can include BRC-20 balance changes by inscribing satoshis with metadata that represents token amounts. When these inscribed tokens are transferred, the BRC-20 balance is updated accordingly, reflecting changes in token ownership. Each transfer modifies the token's ledger state while maintaining a history of all transactions on-chain, enabling fungible token transfers alongside the unique ordinal inscriptions within Bitcoin ecosystem.

### Sample Query

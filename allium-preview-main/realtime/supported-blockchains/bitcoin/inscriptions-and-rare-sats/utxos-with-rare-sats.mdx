title: "UTXOs With Rare Sats"
---

UTXOs with rare sats are unspent transaction outputs that contain satoshis considered unique or special due to their position in Bitcoin's minting history, such as the first satoshi of a block or other notable events. These rare sats can be tracked and valued for their scarcity, adding a collectible aspect to UTXOs. When transferred, the UTXO retains the rare sat's provenance, making it distinct from regular satoshis and appealing to collectors within the Ordinals ecosystem.

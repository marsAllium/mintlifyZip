Blocks are the building blocks of blockchains and rollups. A block contains transactions which contains instructions which will alter the state of the solana blockchain incrementally. Transactions within a block can only be executed one after the other, not in parallel. Instructions within a transaction can only be executed one after the other, not in parallel.

title: "Transactions"

Transactions are cryptographically signed instructions from accounts.

An account will initiate a transaction to update the state of the Ethereum network. Transactions always originate from an externally owned account (a smart contract can not initiate a transaction). Transactions, which change the state of the EVM, need to be broadcast to the whole network. Any node can broadcast a request for a transaction to be executed on the EVM; after this happens, a validator will execute the transaction and propagate the resulting state change to the rest of the network.

### Action labels

When using the API, transactions are enriched with action labels that convey the primary intention of the transaction from the perspective of the wallet that created the transaction. Action labeling coverage is not guaranteed to be exhaustive, but will be improved over time.

**Data Tip**

* **SQL**: Our realtime data is powered by **Postgres SQL**.

* **Timestamps:** All timestamps are in **Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)**.

* **Prices:** All prices-related data are in **USD denomination** unless otherwise stated

* **Address Casing:** All EVM addresses are in **lower casing**.

* **Native token:** Native tokens are presented by **zero address** for the respective chain. E.g for Ethereum and most EVM chains: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, Tron: `T9yD14Nj9j7xAB4dbGeiX9h8unkKHxuWwb`

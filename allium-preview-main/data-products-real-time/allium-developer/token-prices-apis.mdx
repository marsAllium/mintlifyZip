</Info>
Our Token Prices API provides real-time token prices and historical price data for Solana tokens. Prices are derived from Allium's real-time DEX trade feeds and aggregated at minute, hour, and day granularities.

**Key Features:**

* **Real-Time & Historical Data:** Latest prices update in real time, while historical prices are available at multiple time intervals and granularities.

* **On-Chain Price Calculation:** Prices are computed directly from on-chain DEX trades, ensuring low freshness and comprehensive coverage.

* **Newly Launched Token Support:** A token's price is available as soon as its first on-chain DEX trade occurs.

* **Major Quote Tokens Supported:** Token prices are available for pairs traded against `SOL`, `mSOL`, `USDC`, and `USDT`.

**Current Limitations & Roadmap:**

* Currently, the Prices API only supports Solana-based DEX trade pricing.

* Support for additional chains and liquidity pool-based pricing is in development.

* This API is under active development, and improvements are ongoing.

If you are interested in testing the Prices API or need pricing data for other chains, please [reach out](https://allium.so/contact) to us.

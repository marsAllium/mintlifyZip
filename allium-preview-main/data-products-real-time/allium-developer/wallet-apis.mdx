Allium's real-time Wallet APIs can be used to build wallets and apps that require a wallet centric view of the blockchain. Use cases range from data-rich wallet activity feeds all the way to block level historical token balances.

We support most major EVMs, Solana and Bitcoin.

### Getting Started

To start testing our APIs, first step is to request for a trial account [https://www.allium.so/contact](https://www.allium.so/contact). Once your account is approved, you will be granted access to Allium App, where you can get your API key.

### Authentication

Go to [https://app.allium.so/settings/api-keys](https://app.allium.so/settings/api-keys) to retrieve your API key, which you will use to perform requests to our APIs.

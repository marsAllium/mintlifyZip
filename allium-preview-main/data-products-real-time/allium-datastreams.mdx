Allium offers realtime blockchain data streams via Kafka, Pub/Sub, and Amazon SNS, providing guaranteed delivery of fresh, accurate, & enriched data for 70+ blockchains.

Allium Datastreams delivers real-time event data through enterprise message brokers (Kafka/PubSub/SNS). This service provides instant transaction and event notifications, allows custom filtering and subscriptions, and ensures guaranteed message ordering for reliable data delivery.
<Info>
We highly recommend this approach over web hooks as (1) it **guarantees delivery** even if either side has an outage, (2) most event buses have a retention policy that allows **replay of historical messages**

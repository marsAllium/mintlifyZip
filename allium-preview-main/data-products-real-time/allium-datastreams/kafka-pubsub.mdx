Allium makes it easy to stream real-time data directly into your applications using Google Cloud Pub/Sub or Apache Kafka. These integrations allow you to process and analyze data as it arrives, ensuring your systems are always up-to-date.

#### Why Stream Data?

Streaming data enables instant processing and real-time decision-making, crucial for applications that rely on the latest information.

#### Pub/Sub Integration

With Google Cloud Pub/Sub, Allium lets you consume data streams directly from a Pub/Sub subscription, keeping your systems in sync with real-time data.

#### Kafka Integration

Allium's Apache Kafka integration allows you to tap into high-throughput, low-latency data streams, perfect for handling large volumes of real-time information.

Weâ€™re building out more detailed self-serve documentation, but this overview provides a quick start to integrating your data streams with Allium.

Allium handles and maintains bulk data delivery and the full life cycle management of data delivery that has hidden complexities that is commonly overlooked:

**Bulk delivery -&#x20;**&#x41;llium can deliver 100s of TBs of data into any destination in days, so customers can avoid writing their own scripts to hit a static API

**Seamless schema updates & migrations -&#x20;**&#x41;llium leverages an Iceberg table format together with clearly-defined SOPs for any schema changes to ensure backward compatibility

## Benefits of Datashares

* Seamlessly **join their data with Allium's blockchain data** in their **own secure environment**

* **Privacy** -> Allium won't be able to see the queries our customers run with this method

* **Manage their own compute** workloads

* Run their **own complex analysis** on top of the whole 1 Petabyte dataset (e.g. constructing a graph database on top)

Allium supports a wide range of data connectors and data lake destinations to seamlessly integrate blockchain data with your own data lake.

We have our data in nearly every Data Query Engine, and multiple regions - *US East*, *Central*, *West* and also some *Europe&#x20;*&#x72;egions.

#### Allium Explorer's Query Runner:

The query runner is the main engine of the Allium Explorer. Users can effortlessly query data over all the blockchains offered by Allium in a single platform.

**Features**

* **Multi-Chain Support:** Write SQL queries that span across all blockchains offered by Allium in a single platform.

* **Unified Data Schema**: Leverage abstracted data models across different blockchains (e.g `crosschain.dex.trades` and `crosschain.stablecoin.transfers`) to simplify query writing.

* **Parameterized Queries:** Create dynamic, reusable SQL statements with user-defined parameters.

* **SQL Formatter**: Formats your code to clean, readable SQL code, enhancing collaboration and maintenance.

Using the Explorer Query Runner:

In this example we will show you how to fetch DEX USD Volume for Ethereum, Base, and Solana with parameterized queries.

**Example: Fetch DEX USD Volume for Ethereum, Base, and Solana**

Head to https\://app.allium.so/explorer and click on *New* to create a new query.

Creating the query:

1. Copy and paste the query below into the query editor.

Copy

```
select 
    date(block_timestamp) as date, 
    chain, 
    sum(usd_amount) as usd_volume
from crosschain.dex.trades
where block_timestamp >= current_timestamp - interval '{{last_n_days}} days' and chain in ('ethereum', 'base', 'solana')
group by all
order by 1 desc
```

1. The `{{last_n_days}}` is a parameter that you can use to filter the data. There will be a window to input the parameter value once a parameter is defined.

2. Click on *Format* to format the query.

3. Click on *Save* to save the query.

4. Click on *Run* (or Crtl+Enter / Mac: Cmd+Enter) to execute the query.

### 2. Generate API keys and run asynchronously

Allium Explorer exposes the following endpoints through a REST API to fetch and poll your query run.

1. POST /api/v1/explorer/queries/\{query\_id}/run-async: Execute the query asynchronously. This creates a query run ID for you to poll the status and results from

2. GET /api/v1/explorer/query-runs/\{run\_id}/status: Get the status of a query run as an enumeration of created | queued | running | success | failed | canceled

3. GET /api/v1/explorer/query-runs/\{run\_id}/results: Get the results of a query run with status success.

The typical flow would be to

1. Create a query run, and get the run\_id

2. Poll the query run status using the run\_id in a while loop

3. When the query run status is success, get the results

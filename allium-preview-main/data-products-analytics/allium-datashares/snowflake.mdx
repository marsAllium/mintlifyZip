Allium offers direct access to historical blockchain data via Snowflake Shares and our Allium Explorer UI.

This allows you to select your preferred way of querying our data, whether be it through Snowflake, Allium Explorer's UI or programmatically via API.

## Blockchains and Schemas Supported

Our historical batch data is currently hosted on Snowflake.

### Snowflake Shares

We can set up [Snowflake Data Shares](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-sharing-intro) with your account so you can use our data in your own Snowflake Environment.

With this integration, users can join their data directly with our tables. Other tools like DBT, Power BI, Looker, Metabase, and hex.tech can also be integrated natively with our data through data share.

Learn more about Snowflake Shares [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-sharing-intro)**.**

#### Receiving shares

In order to receive Snowflake Shares, you will need to retrieve your Snowflake account's identifier. See this [guide here on how to do so.](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier#finding-the-organization-and-account-name-for-an-account)

### Allium App: Explorer Mode

The Allium App provides a web interface for querying all our Snowflake data. The historical batch data we offer can be queried through the Explorer UI.

Users can query Snowflake on Explorer via:

* [Web-based query editor](/data-products-analytics/allium-explorer/query-runner)

* [REST API](/data-products-analytics/allium-explorer/explorer-api)

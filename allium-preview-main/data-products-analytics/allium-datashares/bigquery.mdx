Allium offers access to all the blockchains through BigQuery Data Shares through their native Analytics hub: [https://cloud.google.com/analytics-hub](https://cloud.google.com/analytics-hub)

All we need is your GCP IAM account email address and we can share the whole history of the all the blockchains in seconds. This is typically either your own email address or the email address associated with a [service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview): [https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview)
